Objective: Design a multi-level testbench simulating a block-level integration of two small DUTs (e.g., AND + OR gates).

Tasks:

Create two small DUT modules: one 2-input AND gate and one 2-input OR gate.

Build separate UVM agents for each DUT.

Integrate both agents into a top-level environment.

Practice build and connect phases explicitly in all components.

Add print statements in each UVM phase (e.g., build_phase, connect_phase, run_phase) to observe the flow.

Goal: Practice UVM phasing and learn to scale the architecture from component to integration-level
